Assignments written in C for CS449 (Fall 2013)


###Assignment 1
#####RoShamBo and EXIF Viewer
The first half of Assignment 1 introduces us to C through a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. This small project focuses on reading in user input and displaying it using format specifiers. For reference, I have found the following to be useful:
- The Secrets of printf : http://byuh.doncolton.com/courses/tut/printf.pdf
- The C Library Reference Guide : http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/webmonkeys/book/c_guide/

The second half of Assignment 1 is a bit more involved, as it has us parsing through a JPEG file to read the EXIF/TIFF information.
